'''
Given a m x n binary matrix mat, find the 0-indexed position of the row that contains the maximum count of ones, and the number of ones in that row.

In case there are multiple rows that have the maximum count of ones, the row with the smallest row number should be selected.

Return an array containing the index of the row, and the number of ones in it.

 

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both rows have the same number of 1's. So we return the index of the smaller row, 0, and the maximum count of ones (1). So, the answer is [0,1]. 
'''

'''

 We want to find the row with the maximum number of 1s using binary search, we can take advantage of the fact that each row is sorted in descending order. 
 The binary search will help determine the first occurrence of 1 in each row efficiently.

Key Idea:
Use binary search to find the first occurrence of 1 in each row. The number of 1s in the row will then be number_of_columns - index_of_first_1.
Track the row with the maximum number of 1s.
Algorithm:
For each row, perform a binary search to find the index of the first 1.
Calculate the count of 1s in that row.
Keep track of the row index with the maximum number of 1s.
Time complexity: O(nlogm), where 
ùëõ
n is the number of rows and 
ùëö
m is the number of columns.'''
